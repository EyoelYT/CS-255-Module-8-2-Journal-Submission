# CS-255-Module-8-2-Journal-Submission

** Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted us to design a system that can provide students online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. They are trying to solve the issue of the lack of better driver training.

** What did you do particularly well?

I felt like I designed the UML diagrams in a good way. It challenged me to think of actors that were needed but were not mentioned as much, such as the payment services and alerts from the DMV.

** If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise and refine the lists of functional and non-functional requirements since I feel like I mentioned some of the requirements in both categories.

** How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users' needs based from the client's interview logs. It provided me with a much better insight into the user's goals, behaviors, and pain points.&nbsp;If the system does not heed the user's requirements, it would become unlikely to be adopted and used by the target audience.&nbsp;

** How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

You first have to seek and understand the requirements and identify the problem you will have to solve. This is the gathering of information phase. Then split the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. After you identify and understand how the different components of the system fall together, you will start creating the designs.&nbsp;
